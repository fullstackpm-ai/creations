# Aary Sheoran - January 29, 2026

## Context
Weekly 1:1 with Aary (Product Manager - Accounting)

## Summary
- Lease charge posting bug discovered - new vs renewed leases treated same; was spec'd correctly (bold/red) but still implemented wrong
- Promotion assessment in progress - Aary requesting peer reviews from Lindsay, Tim, Rachel, Lori, Brian
- Guidance on ruthless prioritization: accounting is existential (not growth); focus on must-haves like working trial balance, bank rec
- Deep AI strategy discussion: property managers won't cede control because properties are financial assets; need "illusion of control" through configurable guardrails

## Decisions
- Accounting prioritization lens: existential (working trial balance, bank rec, payment issues) > nice-to-have (collections manager, dispute automation)
- AI invoice processing: scope to tasks only; consider introducing AI at vendor submission rather than AP approval

## Action Items
- [ ] @me: Complete Aary's promotion assessment, share in performance meeting
- [ ] @Aary: Ruthlessly prioritize across 4 accounting domains (core, AP, tenant ledger, delinquency)
- [ ] @Aary: Run AI invoice submission approach by CC for input
- [ ] @Aary: Read "Thinking about AI in Ender" document for guiding principles

## Follow-up
- AI strategy to be discussed in business team meeting
- Performance review meeting (scheduled)

## Reflections
- Requirements clarity problem: even bold/red spec highlighting didn't prevent wrong implementation - systemic issue worth investigating
- Aary asking the right questions about AI adoption in PM industry - good product instincts
- Key insight for AI products in PropTech: "illusion of control" > pure efficiency; financial assets = high stakes = need configurable guardrails
- Intent resolution is critical for AI trust - multiple intents in simple queries (e.g., "open work orders" has 5+ meanings)
- CC (domain expert) proving invaluable - "if we had her in 2021, we'd be successful by now"
