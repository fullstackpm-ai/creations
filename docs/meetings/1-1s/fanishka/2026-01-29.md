# Fanishka - January 29, 2026

## Context
Recurring 1:1

## Summary
- Discussed director of product recruiting - changed title from "Principal Product" to reduce adverse selection and get more qualified candidates with management experience
- Deep dive on maintenance triage bot - Fanishka sees this as the foundation for a full "maintenance bot" that could automate dispatcher work (triage → categorization → vendor assignment → scheduling via TimeFold)
- Reviewed rehab module readiness for launch - tested by accounting team, all core flows working (PO assignment, lien waivers, certifications)
- Identified future enhancements: vendor bidding module for cost savings, vendor scorecard, internal assignee trade type matching

## Decisions
- Move bot meeting to 4PM (Lou's design interview was cancelled)
- Rehab module is ready for launch pending load testing
- Will write a case study/white paper on the rehab module after launch

## Action Items
- [ ] @me: Connect with Jesus and Brian about load testing for rehab module before launch
- [ ] @me: Schedule case study/white paper for rehab module post-launch
- [ ] @fanishka: Add author tracking to activity log (who logged each entry)
- [ ] @fanishka: Review related work orders performance issue (may be slow on homes with many work orders)

## Follow-up
- Measure occupancy/renewal rates to validate maintenance improvements aren't just from reduced submissions
- Discuss trash-out workflow for inspections in future planning
- Review punch list / change order tracking alternatives at next sync

## Reflections
- Fanishka demonstrates strong product thinking - connected triage bot to larger vision of automated dispatching with multiple specialized agents
- Good collaborative dynamic where Fanishka lets stakeholders (Kevin/Paul) talk through their own objections rather than defending prematurely
- Adverse selection concept applied well to recruiting - clear job titles reduce noise in applicant pool
