# Jon Lonsdale - January 30, 2026

## Context
Recurring 1:1 with Jon (investor/board). Jon in Miami for a wedding.

## Summary
- AI automation initiatives in full force - Amog delivering HVAC bot POC next week; judgment engine handed off to Luke/Randy to reduce bottlenecks
- Principal/Director PM hire still challenging - pipeline exists (2-3 interviews/week) but caliber isn't there; Amazon layoffs may improve talent pool
- Discussed comp model adjustments - Jon prefers widening gap between "meets" (2.5%) and "exceeds" (7.5%) to retain top performers rather than raising baseline
- Five Whys analysis delayed to end of next week - using opportunity to go deep and test all application parts

## Decisions
- Comp model: Keep "meets" at 2.5%, increase "exceeds" to 7.5%, promotion at 12.5% - prioritize retaining top performers over raising baseline
- Budget tolerance confirmed - Jon OK with up to 5% burn increase for comp adjustments
- Stack ranking approach agreed - maintain forced distribution (10% below, ~55% meets, ~25% exceeds, ~10% promotion)
- Folio candidate rejected - indecisiveness in career decision is disqualifying for product leadership

## Action Items
- [ ] @me: Complete Five Whys analysis by end of next week
- [ ] @me: Schedule Five Whys review meeting with Jon next week
- [ ] @me: Continue PM hiring - 4-5 hours/week, leverage Amazon layoff network
- [ ] @me: Review COO dashboard with Scott next week and gather feedback
- [ ] @Jon: Review COO dashboard draft (link sent during call)

## Follow-up
- Jon has big meetings next week: Place.com (40k brokers), PMI (2nd largest PM franchise), Evernest CEO, Mynd CEO
- Discuss Place.com partnership opportunities after Jon's intro calls
- Track Andre (PM candidate) - meeting with Randy today

## Reflections
- Good alignment on philosophy: prioritize retaining top performers over broad raises
- Jon wants data before finalizing comp - "what does meets actually mean?" - need clearer definitions
- Pattern: Akshay proactively delegating (judgment engine to Luke) to avoid being bottleneck - healthy scaling behavior
- Market context discussion valuable - layoffs creating better talent pool, being selective is OK
