# Lori Souza - Friday, January 30, 2026

## Context
Recurring 1:1

## Summary
- Evergreen release process improved: release notes by Friday, QA server available Monday for pre-release testing
- Top 3 priorities confirmed: Bank Rec, Vendor Credit Memos, Retained Earnings (low-hanging fruit items are nuisances, not game-changers)
- Ticket review bottleneck: engineers not responding, Lori pinging 2-3x
- Feature flags identified as solution for accountant change resistance (vs slowing to monthly releases) - gives them control without slowing feedback loop

## Decisions
- Use feature flags more aggressively for accounting features
- Lori to voice prioritization opinions publicly in Monday meetings
- If engineers don't respond to ticket reviews → schedule a meeting directly
- Keep 3-week release cadence (monthly would delay feedback too much)

## Action Items
- [ ] @Lori: Meet with Ari today/weekend to align on ticket priorities
- [ ] @Lori: Schedule meetings with non-responsive engineers
- [ ] @Lori: Surface prioritization concerns in Monday prioritization meeting
- [ ] @Lori: Give performance reviews for Ari, Lindsey, Tim, Ann

## Follow-up
- How did retained earnings discussion go on Monday?
- Bank rec Figma feedback from Evergreen?
- Is the new QA testing process working for them?

## Reflections
- Lori thinking strategically: layering autonomy into every feature request so Evergreen can operate independently (scaling mindset)
- Key insight on accountants: "We have to trust it before we allow change. We have to see the process entirely before we commit." → Feature flags give them that control without blocking releases
- Lori thriving in ambiguity - enjoys not knowing exactly what each day brings (contrast to her previous predictable role)
- Shared positive feedback: Ari appreciates working with her, she's been a "super positive value add" - I no longer have to worry about accounting
