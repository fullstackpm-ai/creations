# Jess Manner - January 26, 2026

## Context
Weekly 1:1 with Jess (Product Manager - Leasing/Prospects)

## Summary
- Performance review coming in ~2 weeks - Akshay will gather peer feedback including from Evergreen team (Andy, etc.)
- Jess asked to write self-assessment: career goals, what excites her about Ender/AI, what doesn't - especially important at 5-year mark
- Prospect chatbot spec sent to Amog for review
- Automated outbound messages: use Andy's flowchart as starting point, hard-code templates initially
- Concessions feature: will hard-code specific types first (one month free, $X off), Kenny getting list from Evergreen
- Deep discussion on channels vs cases architecture - current channels exist because no auto-classification; AI could enable case-based routing

## Decisions
- Performance review scheduled for ~2 weeks out with peer feedback
- Outbound messages: hard-code templates first, send to Evergreen for approval (faster than building settings UI)
- Concessions: start with specific hard-coded types that Evergreen uses, not configurable system
- For application messages (complex multi-dimensional logic): ask Amog if agent-based approach would be easier than rules engine

## Action Items
- [ ] @me: Schedule performance review meeting in ~2 weeks
- [ ] @me: Get feedback from Andy/Evergreen team for Jess's review
- [ ] @Jess: Write self-assessment for performance review (career goals, AI excitement, what motivates)
- [ ] @Jess: Create tickets for automated outbound prospect messages (from Andy's flowchart)
- [ ] @Jess: Ask Amog about prospect chatbot launch timeline
- [ ] @Jess: Get confirmed concession list from Kenny/Evergreen
- [ ] @Jess: Talk to Kenny/Andy about channels vs inboxes approach

## Follow-up
- Performance review meeting (~2 weeks)
- Prospect chatbot progress check with Amog

## Reflections
- Jess at 5-year mark - important to assess career trajectory and alignment with AI-focused direction
- Channels architecture is legacy of pre-AI world; case-based routing is ideal end state
- Key insight: "Think from the perspective of what would be useful from an AI-first automation standpoint, then define the experience using that lens"
- Application messaging complexity (status × listing × other apps) might be better suited for agent than rules engine
- Concessions accounting handled by finance team (scheduled lease credits) - just need leasing-side integration
