# Tim Crowe - January 29, 2026

## Context
Weekly 1:1 with Tim (Engineering Manager)

## Summary
- Lindsay performance concerns - she's feeling pressure, risk of burnout; aligned that she's doing well but may not be "exceeds" level anymore
- Werner single point of failure - FedRAMP work is unbounded/unscoped; Akshay wants to hire DevOps/security engineer as insurance
- AI tooling improvements - engineers need database access for bug fixing (high leverage); bug deep dive tool ready for testing
- Discussion on AI + documentation strategy - seniority matters more now because prompt quality = output quality

## Decisions
- Lindsay evaluation: both aligned she's performing well, not at risk, just calibrating from mid-year "exceeds"
- Will hire DevOps/security engineer as insurance against Werner knowledge concentration
- AI database access ticket reprioritized to high
- 5-whys analysis will be a proper ticketed task (5 points) with prep time

## Action Items
- [ ] @me: Draft job description for DevOps/security engineer
- [ ] @me: Create ticket for 5-whys performance analysis
- [ ] @me: Schedule 5-whys meeting after prep work done
- [ ] @Tim: Connect with Werner on FedRAMP scope (joint meeting)
- [ ] @Tim: Test bug deep dive tool (`/bugs::backend-deep-dive`), get engineer feedback
- [ ] @Tim: Delete stale AI service code from codebase
- [ ] @Tim: Look into AI + debugger integration

## Follow-up
- Discuss next week: "How does seniority/experience limit AI potential?"
- Product documentation exercise - validate against code via Claude

## Reflections
- Lindsay situation highlights perception vs reality gap - she thinks she's underperforming, leadership sees her as solid
- Werner pattern: takes on projects that make him irreplaceable (rational from IC perspective, problematic for org)
- AI insight: prompt quality directly proportional to engineer experience/scars - junior engineers may not be able to harness AI's full potential
- Documentation as "company brain" - well-structured authoritative docs let AI one-shot any task
