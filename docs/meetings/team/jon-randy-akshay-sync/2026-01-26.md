# Jon / Randy / Akshay Sync - January 26, 2026

## Context
Leadership sync on engineering AI adoption and cultural issues

## Attendees
Akshay Ghurye, Jon Lonsdale, Randy Herzog

## Summary
- **AI adoption update**: Every engineer using AI; three bottlenecks identified: tooling (Werner's K8s work), documentation/context, database access for debugging
- **Junior engineer concern**: AI recommendations may be taken at face value without understanding - hope is code review catches issues
- **Tim documenting patterns**: Design docs and patterns written in codebase so AI can reference them (Matt converted to derived table pattern in one shot because pattern was well-documented)
- **Randy's ask**: Create "AI wins" channel for visibility into engineering AI successes
- **Velocity report**: Akshay wants weekly engineering velocity report; Justin building it (requires Jira data)
- **AI chatbot initiative**: Alessandro, Tim, Amog working on it; Akshay meeting daily starting this week
- **Ork AI vs AWS Bedrock**: Default to AWS; 2 weeks foundational work, then comparative pilot
- **DB down frustration**: Randy alarmed this problem persists after years; solution was always "download faster" not "need less data"
- **Cultural issue**: Engineers don't escalate or fix fundamental problems; junior engineers affected most by DB down, seniors work around it

## Decisions
- Add Jon and Randy to existing AI Slack channel
- Default to AWS Bedrock; use Ork AI pilot to evaluate if differentiation exists
- Two weeks foundational AI work, then comparative pilot

## Action Items
- [ ] @me: Add Jon and Randy to AI Slack channel
- [ ] @me: Figure out how to insert leadership into engineering blockers without being intrusive
- [ ] @Justin: Build engineering velocity report (Jira data)
- [ ] @Justin: Work on DB down data subset solution

## Follow-up
- Engineering velocity report review (once built)
- Ork AI vs Bedrock pilot (2 weeks out)

## Reflections
- DB down is a symbol of cultural issue: "never in my career have I worked somewhere that's broken and not fixed it myself, escalated, or quit" - Randy
- Senior engineers not affected by DB down (they work around it), so they don't prioritize fixing it; junior engineers affected but lack skill to fix
- Pattern: team assumes problems are unsolvable after first failure instead of escalating
- Randy's insight: "We have to be involved when they fail" - leadership needs insertion point for blocked problems
- Justin improving rapidly with investment ("the more I invest in Justin, the better he gets")
