# AI Project Sync - January 28, 2026

## Attendees
Tim Crowe, Alessandro (alm), Amogh Iska, Akshay Ghurye

## Context
Recurring sync to align engineering (Tim, Alessandro, Amogh) and product (Akshay) on AI assistant implementation.

## Summary
- Discussed status of Alessandro's AI assistant design doc - Amogh has provided comments, Tim still needs to review
- Akshay shared work on standardizing AI requirements language for product team (intents, tasks framework)
- Debated data storage approach: consensus on sending unstructured/exploratory data to S3 rather than database JSON fields
- Agreed to use AWS Bedrock for MVP, with understanding it's a "two-way door" decision that can be revisited
- Discussed service naming/scoping: should be "AI Assistant" not "LLM Service" to clarify its specific charter vs generic tooling

## Decisions
- Use AWS Bedrock (models layer) for MVP - provides Java SDK and enterprise SLA
- Store exploratory/unstructured AI data in S3, not database metadata fields
- Service should be named/scoped as "AI Assistant" to distinguish from generic AI tooling
- For future Bedrock agents, use "agent core" not "agents" (per Akshay's Bedrock contact)
- Fanishka and Jess will be invited as observers (primary PMs for these projects)

## Action Items
- [ ] @Tim: Complete review of Alessandro's design doc (tonight)
- [ ] @Alessandro: Incorporate Tim's comments and Amogh's feedback, finalize doc (tomorrow)
- [ ] @Amogh: Share AI workflow ideas document with Akshay
- [ ] @Amogh: Optionally write up OCR agent approach using Bedrock
- [ ] @me: Continue iterating with Fanishka on maintenance triage requirements in standardized format
- [ ] @me: Invite Fanishka and Jess to this recurring meeting

## Follow-up
- RKI pilot approximately 2 weeks out - need to assess if static docs + APIs will be ready
- Need clear MVP requirements/definition of done for applicant chatbot
- Consider OpenRouter enterprise tier if model-switching flexibility becomes important

## Key Technical Discussion

**Strong typing vs weak typing for AI data:**
- Tim: Strong preference for strongly-typed fields even during iteration - compiler checks are valuable from minute 20 onward
- Alessandro: Proposed JSON metadata for flexibility during experimentation
- Compromise: Store exploratory data in S3 (not database) as "unstructured data" for programmatic access later, not "metadata"

**Service architecture layers:**
- Generic tools layer (reusable across all AI use cases)
- Agent-specific orchestration layer (AI assistant, maintenance triage agent, etc.)
- Single responsibility principle should apply

**Three AI use cases identified:**
1. AI Assistant (chatbot) - current focus
2. Agentic workflows (maintenance triage, widgets)
3. Headless automated workflows (LLMs for subjective decisions)
