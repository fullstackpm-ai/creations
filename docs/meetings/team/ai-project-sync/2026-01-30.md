# Daily AI Sync - January 30, 2026

## Context
Recurring daily sync for AI/LLM project work. Attendees: Tim Crowe, Amog Iska, Alessandro.

## Summary
- AWS Bedrock permissions now set up for prod and QA environments - Amog tested embedding/LLM/classification models successfully, needs to clean up base model code
- Alessandro's MCP server for Ender DB is ~80% done - generates schema docs, table relationships, SQL examples via Java reflection + Rust tree-sitter parsing
- Extended philosophical discussion on Rust vs Java, AI-assisted coding patterns, and whether "anyone can maintain code they don't understand via LLMs"
- Tim concerned about creating "software islands" in unfamiliar languages; Alessandro argues engineering hours are no longer a constraint with parallel agent work

## Decisions
- Amog will observe Alessandro doing parallel agent work as a 1:1 knowledge transfer first, before broader team rollout
- Tim wants to run an experiment: refactor something fast to test Alessandro's claims about AI-accelerated development
- Need to schedule meeting with Werner to discuss his position on why Ender's codebase is "hostile to agents"
- Static customer docs (business logic) will live in repo's customer guides section; per-customer RAG customization is a future enhancement

## Action Items
- [ ] @Amog: Clean up base model code and submit PR for review (today/weekend)
- [ ] @Amog: Start building APIs and embedding workflow on top of current branch
- [ ] @Alessandro: Finish MCP server by Monday (another 1-2 hours of work)
- [ ] @Alessandro: Schedule 1:1 with Amog to demonstrate parallel agent workflow
- [ ] @Tim: Schedule meeting with Werner + Alessandro to discuss agentic coding constraints
- [ ] @Tim: Design experiment to test rapid refactoring claims

## Follow-up
- Werner apparently wrote up a position paper on why Ender's system is constrained for agentic use - sent to Randy/Jon. Tim feels left out of this conversation.
- Java 11 is blocking use of newer libraries - should upgrade to latest stable version
- Tim wants to be convinced Rust is better than Kotlin before fully buying in
- Question: Should team invest in learning Rust, or stick to Java?

## Reflections
- Tension between Alessandro's "move fast with AI" philosophy and Tim's "simple/grokable by all levels" design philosophy
- Tim's concern about "sugar rush" - fast development now creating tech debt later
- Alessandro's claim: "Engineering hours are no longer a constraint" - could rewrite 500k LOC app in 1-2 weeks with specs
- Tim felt blindsided by Werner's paper going to leadership without him - organizational communication issue
- Good model: Tim stayed curious and interrogated the approach rather than dismissing it
