# Product Prioritization Meeting - January 26, 2026

## Context
Weekly product prioritization - reviewing Jira queues across PMs

## Attendees
Akshay Ghurye, Fanishka (Isha), Aary Sheoran, Anne Gagnon, Lori Souza, Luke Kiely, Jessica Manner, Jordan Bishop

## Summary
- **Isha**: Notifications tickets still top priority, one got estimated (32146); vendor mobile view in design (not blocker - vendors use desktop + print)
- **Aary**: AI invoice verification (high), VCMs (highest), TLV2 items (3 releases away)
- **Lori**: Bank rec, retained earnings, security deposits bulk print, vendor remit address - several waiting for back end review
- **Jess**: Signing process tickets pushed to estimation; needs to clean up old tickets
- **Jordan**: DACA flag ticket needs front end review; charge schedule import ready; need to check lease import status
- **Luke**: Bulk optimization shipping tonight/tomorrow; tenant portal work ongoing
- **Anne**: Working on VCM design, bank rec next

## Key Discussions

### Payment Status for Vendors
- Currently vendors see "sending payment" but not ACH details
- Discussed surfacing on vendor portal - Akshay: "no harm in showing this"
- Aary concern: might trigger "why haven't you paid me" questions
- Decision: Build for internal first, then extend to vendor portal

### TLV2 Timeline
- 3 releases away (scheduled credits → charge schedules on third party basis)
- Related import tickets lower priority until launch

### Ticket Tracking Improvement
- Created "not ready for review" tag for draft/WIP tickets
- Helps PMs track items still being finalized

- Vendor Credit Memos (VCM) - with Anne for design
