# Walk the Store - January 24, 2026

## Context
Weekly Friday demo meeting - engineering shows new features to leadership

## Attendees
Fanishka (presenter), Matt Schultz, Jon Lonsdale, Randy Herzog, Kamran Malik, Anne Gagnon, Akshay Ghurye

## Summary
- Fanishka demoed the new TimeFold-powered work order recommendation engine launching this release
- V1: Click "Recommend" on a work order to get ranked internal assignees with reasons (travel time, workload balance, availability)
- V2 (upcoming): Nightly bulk optimization that auto-schedules all unassigned work orders to internal techs
- System uses hard constraints (no overlap, right market, working hours) and soft constraints (minimize travel, balance workload, meet due dates)

## Decisions
- TimeFold is charged as annual fee, passed on to Evergreen and other clients
- Feature will be toggleable per PM (can start/pause/manually trigger)
- External vendor recommendations don't need TimeFold - just market + compliance + trade type matching
- For now, skip pre/post impact analysis since Evergreen already believes in it - revisit if upselling to new customers

## Action Items
- [ ] @Fanishka: Investigate why "best" and "fair" recommendations don't show reasons (Jon's feedback)
- [ ] @Fanishka: Ask Evergreen for mileage/GPS data to potentially measure impact later
- [ ] @Fanishka: Track median time-to-assign before vs after TimeFold launch

## Follow-up
- V2 bulk optimization demo in next Walk the Store
- Consider impact metrics if we need to upsell other customers (gas costs, odometer data, time-to-assign)
- Potential to expand TimeFold to other task types beyond work orders (leasing agent inspections, etc.)

## Technical Details

**Hard Constraints (must meet):**
- No overlapping tasks per assignee
- Assignee in correct market
- Within working hours (8AM-5PM)
- Not during out-of-office
- 30-min flexible lunch (12-1PM)
- Max 14-day scheduling window

**Soft Constraints (weighted preferences):**
- Schedule within tenant availability window
- Minimize travel time (uses home address + calendar location)
- Balance workload across techs
- Meet due dates
- Emergency tasks get highest weight

**Architecture:**
- Send all work order + assignee calendar data to TimeFold nightly
- TimeFold returns optimized schedule
- Unassigned work orders go to external vendors manually
