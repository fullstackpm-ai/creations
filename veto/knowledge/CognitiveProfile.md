# Cognitive Profile

Personal cognitive patterns derived from Veto capture data and behavioral analysis. This document describes *how you think* - the mental models, tendencies, and cognitive architecture that shape your work.

## Core Cognitive Patterns

### Pattern 1: Systems Thinking as Default Mode

When you encounter a problem, your brain doesn't think "I should do X." It thinks "I should build a system that does X automatically."

**Evidence:**
- "When starting a veto segment linked to a Trello card, automatically move the card to In Progress"
- "When Claude asks for permission, also make a commit to add that permission... Auto-accumulate trusted permissions"
- "Veto estimate calibration: after ending a segment, compare actual time vs estimate... Track estimation accuracy over time"
- "AI autonomous task execution - AI takes first pass at Trello card tasks by gathering sufficient context"

**Implication:** Your default cognitive mode is *architect*. You see individual problems as instances of a class and instinctively want to solve the class, not the instance. This is why you build tools (Veto, MCPs) instead of just doing tasks.

**Hidden cost:** You spend cognitive energy designing systems during work that's supposed to be about execution. The tool-builder brain doesn't turn off.

### Pattern 2: Friction Intolerance

You have a visceral reaction to repetitive friction. When you hit the same obstacle twice, your brain immediately starts designing it away.

**Evidence:**
- "Allow giving Claude Code default permissions... reduces friction for trusted operations"
- "Give Claude Code permission to run SQL queries directly rather than asking to copy/paste"
- Multiple captures about automating permission accumulation

**Implication:** This is a *taste* - you can feel when something isn't smooth, the way a designer notices misaligned pixels. Friction sensitivity is how your taste manifests.

### Pattern 3: Strong Meta-Cognitive Awareness

You don't just think - you watch yourself think. You catch yourself in emotional reactions (frustration, anxiety) and immediately flag them for analysis rather than acting on them.

**Evidence:**
- "Identity and image is tied to Slack availability - causes anxiety when unavailable. Explore how this impacts deep work"
- "I want to see more progress on feature tickets and get frustrated when I don't see it. Will need to think about it."
- "A lot of work related operational thoughts come in mind when working that distracts me. Need to ponder more on this later."
- "Set up biweekly recurring review of Veto captures... to better understand how I think"

**Implication:** You have an active inner observer. The capture system isn't just for tasks - it's for self-observation. This is rare; most people have reactions without noticing them.

---

### Pattern 4: Leadership Burden as Background Process

People management thoughts intrude constantly, even during deep work. You carry the org in your head - tracking who needs feedback, who needs promotion, what you promised whom.

**Evidence (single day, Thu Jan 22):**
- 06:58 - "Need to hire a Compliance Tzar"
- 08:00 - "Start promotion process for Luke Bell"
- 10:39 - "Discuss BE resource allocation with Tim"
- 13:53 - "Connect with Yuan on Jon followups"
- 14:20 - "Inform Jon about AWS cost changes"

**Implication:** Your brain runs a background process for organizational health that doesn't pause during "deep work." This is structural to the role, not a bug to fix.

**Cross-reference:** BehaviorInsights.md Pattern 27 (Divergent Optimization Functions) - You're optimizing for individual excellence AND organizational health simultaneously.

---

### Pattern 5: Visibility Anxiety

You feel responsible for things you can't see. Lack of visibility triggers anxiety and drives you to build dashboards, tracking systems, and visibility tools.

**Evidence:**
- "Need to get visibility into High & Highest Priority projects that are stale on boards"
- "I want to see more progress on feature tickets and get frustrated when I don't see it"
- "Put in a stricter cadence for WTS so that it doesn't get cancelled"
- "Identity and image is tied to Slack availability"

**Implication:** This is about *control* - not controlling people, but having enough information to understand what's happening. Lack of visibility = loss of control = anxiety.

**Potential intervention:** Explicitly accept what you can't see. Some things will happen without your visibility. That's delegation working, not failing.

---

### Pattern 6: Self-First Accountability

When things aren't working, your default attribution is self-blame, not other-blame. You ask "what am I doing wrong?" before "what are they doing wrong?"

**Evidence:**
- "Had a realization when going through Research that it's not the team that is bad, it's the leadership that is a fool"
- "I want to see more progress on feature tickets and get frustrated when I don't see it. Will need to think about it."

**Implication:** You're the opposite of ego-protective. This is good for growth but can create excessive self-pressure.

**Cross-reference:** BehaviorInsights.md Pattern 3 (Ego Preservation Loop) - You don't exhibit this pattern; you may over-correct in the opposite direction.

---

### Pattern 7: External Validation Seeking for Known Insights

You have insights but don't fully trust them until externally validated. You seek confirmation for things you've already experienced.

**Evidence:**
- "Chat with Claude on whether certain times of the day are proven to be better for deep work than others" - You already know mornings work for you
- "Is my Trello set up optimal to capture sequence of deep work" - Questioning a system that's working

**Implication:** Time spent seeking validation for things you already know experientially.

**Cross-reference:** BehaviorInsights.md Pattern 40 (Self-Persuasion Dependency) - You need to reconstruct insights through external confirmation before they become identity-level.

**Intervention:** Trust your experiential data. You don't need external validation for patterns you've observed yourself.

---

## Temporal Patterns

### Morning Brain Is Most Active AND Most Intrusive

| Time Block | Characteristic |
|------------|----------------|
| 6-10 AM | Highest cognitive activity - both productive AND intrusive thoughts |
| 10 AM-2 PM | Moderate intrusion, often meeting-triggered |
| After 2 PM | Lower capture volume, thoughts slow down |

**Implication:** The hours best for deep work are also when the most thoughts demand capture. High cognitive activity = productive work + intrusive thoughts together.

## The Meta-Pattern: Architect Trapped in Operator Role

Your natural mode is *designing systems* - seeing patterns, building tools, reducing friction, optimizing for the future.

Your current role requires *operating* - managing people, responding to Slack, tracking projects, giving feedback.

**How this plays out in captures:**
- 6:06 AM: Tool idea (architect brain)
- 6:58 AM: Hiring need (operator brain)
- 8:00 AM: Promotion process (operator brain)
- 8:15 AM: Reflection on anxiety (architect brain watching operator brain)
- 9:19 AM: System to track delegation (architect brain trying to solve operator problem)

**Your coping mechanism:** You try to *architect your way out of operating*. Every operator problem (tracking delegations, Slack anxiety, visibility) gets converted into a systems problem (build a delegation tracker, design a Slack schedule, create a dashboard).

**Superpower:** You build tools that actually solve problems.
**Trap:** You're always half in architect mode when you should be fully executing.

## Behavioral Implications

### For Deep Work
- Accept that your brain is always designing - you can't stop systems-thinking
- Use capture as the release valve (already doing this correctly)
- The leadership burden is structural; consider a dedicated "leadership thinking" block

### For Self-Trust
- Stop seeking external validation for experiential insights
- You have the data; operate from your own evidence
- When you notice yourself asking "is X true?" and you've already experienced X, trust it

### For Anxiety Management
- Visibility anxiety is about control
- Explicitly accept what you can't see
- Delegation working = things happening without your visibility

### For Weekly Analysis
- Cross-reference weekly data with these patterns
- New patterns that emerge should update this document
- These patterns are the *lens* for interpreting operational data
