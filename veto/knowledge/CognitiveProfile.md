# Cognitive Profile

Personal cognitive patterns derived from Veto capture data and behavioral analysis. This document describes *how you think* - the mental models, tendencies, and cognitive architecture that shape your work.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-31 (Week 5)
**Data Source:** 106 captures analyzed (Jan 22-31, 2026)

## Core Cognitive Patterns

### Pattern 1: Systems Thinking as Default Mode

When you encounter a problem, your brain doesn't think "I should do X." It thinks "I should build a system that does X automatically."

**Evidence:**
- "When starting a veto segment linked to a Trello card, automatically move the card to In Progress"
- "When Claude asks for permission, also make a commit to add that permission... Auto-accumulate trusted permissions"
- "Veto estimate calibration: after ending a segment, compare actual time vs estimate... Track estimation accuracy over time"
- "AI autonomous task execution - AI takes first pass at Trello card tasks by gathering sufficient context"

**Implication:** Your default cognitive mode is *architect*. You see individual problems as instances of a class and instinctively want to solve the class, not the instance. This is why you build tools (Veto, MCPs) instead of just doing tasks.

**Hidden cost:** You spend cognitive energy designing systems during work that's supposed to be about execution. The tool-builder brain doesn't turn off.

### Pattern 1a: The Shadow Side - Framework Before Feeling

The shadow side of systems thinking: **you systematize emotions before fully experiencing them.**

When an emotion arises, your cognitive sequence is:

```
Feel something → Recognize it → Pattern-match → Categorize → Analyze
```

This entire sequence takes seconds. By the time you're aware of the emotion, you've already converted it into a concept you can manipulate. The raw, messy feeling gets processed into a framework before it's fully inhabited.

**Evidence:**
- Role conflict becomes a table comparing COO vs. CPO scenarios
- Slack anxiety becomes "Visibility Anxiety" (Pattern 5)
- Compulsive tool-building becomes "Systems Thinking as Default Mode"
- Even the RoleReflection exercises structure emotion into templates

**The blindspot for product work:**

> "A subtle blindspot that hinders the product success of otherwise-brilliant 'Systems Thinkers' is that they tend not to pay enough attention to individual human psychology. While they are gifted in seeing & explaining system-wide patterns, they'd be even more successful if they recognized that all systems are ultimately made up of human beings."

You don't ignore psychology - you *systematize* it too quickly. The category gets created before the felt experience is fully received.

**What gets lost:**

| What Emotion Provides | What Logic Cannot Do Alone |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Relevance weighting** | Logic sees 47 factors. Emotion says "these 3 matter." |
| **Pre-verbal pattern matching** | Body recognizes "this is like THAT" before conscious recall |
| **Contradiction detection** | Feeling of "wrongness" when model is incomplete |
| **Motivation encoding** | Logic says what's true. Emotion encodes what you'll actually *do*. |

**How this affects your systematic output:**

*Systematizing INSTEAD OF feeling:*
- Framework borrowed from previous frameworks
- Concepts are clean but inert
- Analysis is correct but doesn't generate action
- Six months later, nothing has changed despite the insight

*Systematizing FROM feeling:*
- Categories emerge from the experience
- Words carry the texture of the thing described
- Framework has motivational weight
- The insight integrates and drives behavior change

**The mechanism:**

Emotion is not noise that interferes with logic. Emotion is a different kind of computation - faster, with access to implicit memory (experiences you can't consciously recall). When you skip emotion, you skip half your processing power.

The feeling of dread, energy, resistance, or relief is your system detecting patterns before your logical mind can articulate them. If you systematize before feeling, you analyze with only the patterns you can consciously recall, missing the implicit database.

**The intervention - Pause Before Framework:**

1. **Notice** - "Something is arising"
2. **Stay with it physically** - Where in the body? What texture? (Not to categorize - just to notice)
3. **Resist naming for 60-90 seconds** - Don't find the pattern yet. Just feel.
4. **Let it move** - Emotions shift if you stay with them. Information emerges.
5. **Then systematize** - Now the framework is grounded in felt experience

**The difference:** You systematize *from* the felt experience rather than *instead of* it. The eventual logic is the same structure, but it carries the weight of real experience and encodes motivation.

**Example - Capture quality:**

High-value capture (feeling first):
> "Identity and image is tied to Slack availability - causes anxiety when unavailable"

This has weight because it describes a felt experience.

Low-value version (concept first):
> "Availability is a component of leadership identity with implications for deep work"

Same logical content. Zero felt truth. This version would not have led to the Visibility Anxiety pattern.

**For RoleReflection exercises:**

Before answering "How does this feel in my body?" - sit in the imagined scenario for 5 minutes without questions. Don't look for answers. Let whatever arises, arise. *Then* the questions.

The template accelerates past the sitting. The intervention is to slow down before the framework.

**The Deeper Trap: Sounding Smart vs. Discovering Truth**

The categories that emerge from genuine feeling are often:
- Embarrassingly simple
- Not novel (others have had this insight)
- Unflattering (they reveal weakness, not strength)
- Hard to explain (they don't fit cleanly into existing frameworks)

The ego doesn't want these. The ego wants patterns that demonstrate intellectual range.

When you reach for a framework before fully feeling, ask: **"Am I reaching for this pattern because it's *true* or because it sounds *sophisticated*?"**

The trap: Your identity is built on pattern recognition. You've been rewarded your whole life for seeing what others miss, for articulating complex things clearly. So when you encounter a new experience, the instinct is to reach for a known framework that sounds impressive rather than sit in not-knowing until something true emerges.

Not-knowing feels vulnerable. Having the pattern feels safe. But the simple, unflattering, hard-to-explain pattern is usually the true one.

**Connection to Pattern 7 (Validation Seeking):**

There's a shadow version of external validation seeking:
> You seek frameworks that will impress others rather than frameworks that are true.

The sophisticated-sounding framework gets social validation. The true-but-simple framework might sound obvious. The ego prefers the former.

**Cross-reference:** This explains why the Veto product brief is architecturally brilliant but light on emotional UX. The system design came from cognitive analysis, not from dwelling in the felt experience of being refused, contradicted, or known by your own tool.

---

### Pattern 2: Friction Intolerance

You have a visceral reaction to repetitive friction. When you hit the same obstacle twice, your brain immediately starts designing it away.

**Evidence:**
- "Allow giving Claude Code default permissions... reduces friction for trusted operations"
- "Give Claude Code permission to run SQL queries directly rather than asking to copy/paste"
- Multiple captures about automating permission accumulation

**Implication:** This is a *taste* - you can feel when something isn't smooth, the way a designer notices misaligned pixels. Friction sensitivity is how your taste manifests.

**Cross-reference:** BehaviorInsights.md Pattern 12 (Taste = Clarity under Constraint)

---

### Pattern 3: Strong Meta-Cognitive Awareness

You don't just think - you watch yourself think. You catch yourself in emotional reactions (frustration, anxiety) and immediately flag them for analysis rather than acting on them.

**Evidence:**
- "Identity and image is tied to Slack availability - causes anxiety when unavailable. Explore how this impacts deep work"
- "I want to see more progress on feature tickets and get frustrated when I don't see it. Will need to think about it."
- "A lot of work related operational thoughts come in mind when working that distracts me. Need to ponder more on this later."
- "Set up biweekly recurring review of Veto captures... to better understand how I think"

**Implication:** You have an active inner observer. The capture system isn't just for tasks - it's for self-observation. This is rare; most people have reactions without noticing them.

---

### Pattern 4: Leadership Burden as Background Process

People management thoughts intrude constantly, even during deep work. You carry the org in your head - tracking who needs feedback, who needs promotion, what you promised whom.

**Evidence (single day, Thu Jan 22):**
- 06:58 - "Need to hire a Compliance Tzar"
- 08:00 - "Start promotion process for Luke Bell"
- 10:39 - "Discuss BE resource allocation with Tim"
- 13:53 - "Connect with Yuan on Jon followups"
- 14:20 - "Inform Jon about AWS cost changes"

**Implication:** Your brain runs a background process for organizational health that doesn't pause during "deep work." This is structural to the role, not a bug to fix.

**Cross-reference:** BehaviorInsights.md Pattern 27 (Divergent Optimization Functions) - You're optimizing for individual excellence AND organizational health simultaneously.

---

### Pattern 5: Visibility Anxiety

You feel responsible for things you can't see. Lack of visibility triggers anxiety and drives you to build dashboards, tracking systems, and visibility tools.

**Evidence:**
- "Need to get visibility into High & Highest Priority projects that are stale on boards"
- "I want to see more progress on feature tickets and get frustrated when I don't see it"
- "Put in a stricter cadence for WTS so that it doesn't get cancelled"
- "Identity and image is tied to Slack availability"

**Implication:** This is about *control* - not controlling people, but having enough information to understand what's happening. Lack of visibility = loss of control = anxiety.

**Potential intervention:** Explicitly accept what you can't see. Some things will happen without your visibility. That's delegation working, not failing.

---

### Pattern 6: Self-First Accountability

When things aren't working, your default attribution is self-blame, not other-blame. You ask "what am I doing wrong?" before "what are they doing wrong?"

**Evidence:**
- "Had a realization when going through Research that it's not the team that is bad, it's the leadership that is a fool"
- "I want to see more progress on feature tickets and get frustrated when I don't see it. Will need to think about it."

**Implication:** You're the opposite of ego-protective. This is good for growth but can create excessive self-pressure.

**Cross-reference:** BehaviorInsights.md Pattern 3 (Ego Preservation Loop) - You don't exhibit this pattern; you may over-correct in the opposite direction.

---

### Pattern 7: External Validation Seeking for Known Insights

You have insights but don't fully trust them until externally validated. You seek confirmation for things you've already experienced.

**Evidence:**
- "Chat with Claude on whether certain times of the day are proven to be better for deep work than others" - You already know mornings work for you
- "Is my Trello set up optimal to capture sequence of deep work" - Questioning a system that's working

**Implication:** Time spent seeking validation for things you already know experientially.

**Cross-reference:** BehaviorInsights.md Pattern 40 (Self-Persuasion Dependency) - You need to reconstruct insights through external confirmation before they become identity-level.

**Intervention:** Trust your experiential data. You don't need external validation for patterns you've observed yourself.

---

### Pattern 8: Energy and Focus Can Diverge

Energy and focus usually track together (8/8, 5/5, 6/6). But after heavy meeting days, they can split.

**Evidence (W05, 01/28):**
- 3:50 PM: Energy 8, Focus 5
- 3:54 PM: Energy 6, Focus 5

Energy recovered, but focus stayed stuck.

**Implication:** Meetings may deplete *focus* more than *energy*. You can feel physically okay but cognitively fragmented. After meeting-heavy blocks, the intervention isn't rest (energy is fine) - it's focus recovery (single-task, low-stakes work to rebuild attention).

**Cross-reference:** This explains why afternoon post-meeting attempts at deep work fail even when you don't feel tired.

---

### Pattern 9: Judgment Over Others Is Uniquely Draining

Tasks requiring you to evaluate or judge another person's work produce the worst focus scores.

**Evidence (W05):**

| Task | Focus | Completed | What It Required |
|------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Personal finance strategy | 8-10 | Yes | Thinking about yourself |
| PM Interview Question refinement | 9 | Yes | Improving a process |
| AWS Connect investigation | 9 | Yes | Technical exploration |
| **PM Performance Assessment** | **2** | **No** | **Judging another person** |

**Implication:** This connects to Pattern 5 (Visibility Anxiety) and authority hesitation. The draining element isn't the cognitive complexity - it's the interpersonal weight.

**Open question:** Is this about:
- Lack of clarity on standards?
- Conflict avoidance?
- Identity incongruence (judging feels misaligned with self-image)?
- Something else?

**Status:** Unprocessed. Requires deeper inquiry.

---

### Pattern 10: Deep Work Unlocks Adjacent Insights

The nominal task isn't always the actual work happening. Deep work on one topic can unlock insights on related topics that were queued in the background.

**Evidence (W05, 01/26):**

Task: "Personal finance strategy"
Actual output: 10 career strategy captures in 4 hours, including:
- "My strategy: move closer to AI value engine, not accumulate titles"
- "I should be known as someone who helps people reason about AI leverage"
- "If you leave without making/reversing AI bets, you're underutilizing"

**Implication:** When you resist a deep work topic, ask: "What *adjacent* question might this unlock?" The resistance might be to the adjacent question, not the stated task. The brain uses one topic as an entry point to process related questions that have been waiting.

---

### Pattern 11: Distractions Are Seeking Something Specific

Distraction impulses aren't random. They correlate with specific cognitive states and seek specific things.

**Evidence (W05 captures):**

| Distraction | Context | What It Seeks |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| LinkedIn | "Triggered while simulating how to grow money" | External validation of professional identity |
| LinkedIn | "Multiple small distractions" | Status comparison, reassurance |
| Muthaiah Muralidharan (cricket) | Afternoon, depleted | Comfort, nostalgia, escape |

**Implication:** LinkedIn appears when doing *hard cognitive work* (validation seeking). Cricket appears when *depleted* (comfort seeking). The question isn't "how do I block distractions?" but "what need is the distraction trying to meet, and can I meet that need more directly?"

**Your own question:** *"Why do I search for Muthaiah Muralidharan on YouTube? Go deeper - what am I seeking?"*

**Status:** Partially processed. Requires deeper inquiry.

---

### Pattern 12: State Log Frequency Is a Self-Monitoring Signal

On hard days, you check in with yourself more often. This is data.

**Evidence (W05):**

| Date | State Logs | Day Type |
|------|------------|----------|
| 01/28 | **3** | **Heaviest meeting day (5.5 hrs)** |
| Other days | 1 | Normal |

**Implication:** High state log frequency indicates a depleting day. The system is being used as a self-awareness tool when stressed, not just a logging tool. Frequency itself is a signal worth tracking.

---

## Temporal Patterns

### Morning Brain Is Most Active AND Most Intrusive

| Time Block | Characteristic |
|------------|----------------|
| 6-10 AM | Highest cognitive activity - both productive AND intrusive thoughts |
| 10 AM-2 PM | Moderate intrusion, often meeting-triggered |
| After 2 PM | Lower capture volume, thoughts slow down |

**Implication:** The hours best for deep work are also when the most thoughts demand capture. High cognitive activity = productive work + intrusive thoughts together.

---

## The Meta-Pattern: Architect Trapped in Operator Role

Your natural mode is *designing systems* - seeing patterns, building tools, reducing friction, optimizing for the future.

Your current role requires *operating* - managing people, responding to Slack, tracking projects, giving feedback.

**How this plays out in captures:**
- 6:06 AM: Tool idea (architect brain)
- 6:58 AM: Hiring need (operator brain)
- 8:00 AM: Promotion process (operator brain)
- 8:15 AM: Reflection on anxiety (architect brain watching operator brain)
- 9:19 AM: System to track delegation (architect brain trying to solve operator problem)

**Your coping mechanism:** You try to *architect your way out of operating*. Every operator problem (tracking delegations, Slack anxiety, visibility) gets converted into a systems problem (build a delegation tracker, design a Slack schedule, create a dashboard).

**Superpower:** You build tools that actually solve problems.
**Trap:** You're always half in architect mode when you should be fully executing.

## Behavioral Implications

### For Deep Work
- Accept that your brain is always designing - you can't stop systems-thinking
- Use capture as the release valve (already doing this correctly)
- The leadership burden is structural; consider a dedicated "leadership thinking" block

### For Self-Trust
- Stop seeking external validation for experiential insights
- You have the data; operate from your own evidence
- When you notice yourself asking "is X true?" and you've already experienced X, trust it

### For Anxiety Management
- Visibility anxiety is about control
- Explicitly accept what you can't see
- Delegation working = things happening without your visibility

### For Weekly Analysis
- Cross-reference weekly data with these patterns
- New patterns that emerge should update this document
- These patterns are the *lens* for interpreting operational data
