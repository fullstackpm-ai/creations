# Role Reflection

Deep reflection on role fit, career architecture, and where natural cognitive patterns align with organizational position.

**Status:** In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-24 (Week 4)
**Trello Card:** Role Architecture Reflection - Org Architect vs Product Architect

---

## The Triggering Insight

From cognitive profile analysis (2026-01-24):

> "You are a Systems Architect trapped in an Operator role. Your natural mode is designing systems - seeing patterns, building tools, reducing friction, optimizing for the future. Your current role requires operating - managing people, responding to Slack, tracking projects, giving feedback."

---

## Current State

**Title:** COO

**Scope:** Product, Engineering, Design, Customer Success

**Leadership gaps:**
- No Product Leader (hiring)
- Engineering Leader (grooming internally)
- Result: Doing 4 jobs, not 1

**Current configuration:** Super-IC with COO title - doing the work that 3-4 leaders should be doing, plus trying to integrate across them.

---

## The Core Question

> "If I had a strong Product Leader and a strong Engineering Leader tomorrow, and my job became purely architecting how Product/Eng/Design/CS work together as a system - would that be energizing or draining?"

This question determines whether the role mismatch is:
- **Situational** (missing lieutenants) → fixable by hiring
- **Fundamental** (wrong seat) → requires role change

## Evidence from Veto Data

### What Energizes (from best days)

| Date | Activity | Category |
|------|----------|----------|
| Jan 18 | Building MCPs (Trello, Calendar) | Technical architecture |
| Jan 19 | AI Ender Product kick-off | Product architecture |
| Jan 20 | Veto refinement | Tool building |
| Weekend | Building Veto at 6 AM | Technical/Product |

### What Drains (from worst days)

| Date | Activity | Category |
|------|----------|----------|
| Jan 22 | Weekly project review | Org operations |
| Various | Performance management | People operations |
| Various | Slack responsiveness anxiety | Org operations |

### Capture Analysis

**Tool/Product captures:** Curiosity-driven, friction-driven, joy-driven
**Org captures:** Frustration-driven, control-driven, burden-driven

## The Three Scenarios

### Scenario A: COO with Strong Leaders

Your job becomes:
- Weekly syncs with each leader
- Cross-functional escalations
- Board/exec communication
- Org design and process architecture
- Culture and hiring bar

**This is architecting the org, not the product.**

**Reflection space:**
```
[To be completed in Session 2]

How does this feel in my body?


What excites me about this?


What creates dread?


```

### Scenario B: CPO or CTO (Someone Else is COO)

Your job becomes:
- Product vision and roadmap
- Technical architecture decisions
- Building tools and systems
- Deep work on hard problems
- Leading by building, not by managing

**This is architecting product/tech, not the org.**

**Reflection space:**
```

How does this feel in my body?


What excites me about this?


What creates dread?


```

### Scenario C: Founder / Start Something New

Your job becomes:
- Small team, you architect everything
- Product, tech, org - no layers
- Full ownership, full responsibility

**This is architecting everything, but at smaller scale.**

**Reflection space:**

How does this feel in my body?


What excites me about this?


What creates dread?

## Session 1: Data Collection

### Energy Audit

*List last 10 work activities. Mark each as energizing (+) or draining (-). Categorize as Org or Product/Tech.*

| Activity | +/- | Category |
|----------|-----|----------|
| 1. | | |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |
| 4. | | |
| 5. | | |
| 6. | | |
| 7. | | |
| 8. | | |
| 9. | | |
| 10. | | |

**Pattern observed:**

### Sunday Night Test

*When you think about Monday morning, what are you excited about? What do you dread?*

**Excited about:**

**Dread:**

**What does this reveal?**

### Flow States

*When did you last lose track of time? What were you doing?*

### Resentment Inventory

*What parts of your job make you resentful? ("I shouldn't have to do this")*

### Fantasy Exercise

*Design your ideal week. Be specific about what you're doing each day.*

| Day | Ideal Activities |
|-----|------------------|
| Monday | |
| Tuesday | |
| Wednesday | |
| Thursday | |
| Friday | |

## Session 2: Thought Experiments

*Completed after sitting with each scenario for 10 minutes.*

### Scenario A Response

### Scenario B Response

### Scenario C Response

---

## Synthesis

*1-page synthesis after both sessions.*

### Which scenario created the most energy in my body?

### Which scenario created dread or relief?

### What does this tell me about where I belong?

### The Decision (or next step)

---

## Implications

### If Scenario A (Stay COO, hire leaders)

- Accelerate Product Leader hire
- Fast-track Engineering Leader development
- Redesign COO role as "org architect"
- Accept that product/tech architecture becomes delegated

### If Scenario B (Move to CPO/CTO)

- Identify who could be COO
- Define transition timeline
- Negotiate role change internally
- Accept org architecture becomes someone else's domain

### If Scenario C (Start something new)

- Longer-term planning required
- Not immediate action
- What conditions would trigger this?
